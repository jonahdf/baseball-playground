# Baseball Stats Playground

Every once in a while, a random thought pops into my mind about baseball stats.

This repo exists so I can experiment with stats and make cool visualizations whenever I have an idea.

To avoid having to do API calls all the time, I've stored some various aggregations and queries in the `data` directory.
